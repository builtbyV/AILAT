# AI Literacy Assessment Test (AILAT)

## Overview

The **AI Literacy Assessment Test (AILAT)**, developed by V—AI Innovation Lab and Venture Studio, is an adaptive diagnostic system designed to evaluate and measure individuals' AI literacy across across four key dimensions:

* **Conceptual Knowledge**: Understanding of AI fundamentals, terminology, capabilities, and limitations
* **Use & Apply Knowledge**: Practical skills in effectively using AI tools
* **Evaluate & Create Knowledge**: Ability to critically assess AI outputs and create solutions
* **Ethics Knowledge**: Understanding of responsible AI practices and implications

Utilizing Item Response Theory (IRT), specifically a 2-Parameter Logistic (2PL) model, AILAT dynamically adjusts questions based on real-time user performance to ensure precise, personalized assessment experiences.

## Key Features

* Adaptive testing using Item Response Theory
* Industry-contextualized question selection
* Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on user performance
* Three-phase assessment structure (Calibration, Adaptive, Scenario)
* LLM-based evaluation of open-ended responses
* Personalized learning recommendations
* Organization-level analytics and insights
